NeeqDMIs Framework Instructions
===============================
- Copy the content of this "Template" folder into your project;
- Extend the abstract class "DMIBox" creating a customized box for your needs: override the method "Setup()" and use it to instantiate all the needed components. You can use the "DMIBoxExample" as an example;
- Into your main code, instantiate your customized DMIBox into the static "Rack", so you can call it from everywhere;
- Build your customized behaviors and, using your customized "Setup()" method, add them into the behaviors list into the corresponding components.

Enjoy!
